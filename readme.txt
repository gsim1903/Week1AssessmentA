What is RSPEC?

Rpec is a dependency for Ruby, it allows access a library of test files to use on our code. 

To initialise rpec in a folder, once ensured this gem is installed (part of bundler, “Bundle Install”) initialise by:

rspec –init 

We would ordinarily have written our test first, then written code to pass them.

Why? - 
Creating something first (to test) is a typical starting point before testing. There needs to be something to test. However, 

Testing added, not sure on the instance double though.
